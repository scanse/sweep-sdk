# libsweep

Low-level Scanse Sweep LiDAR library. Comes as C99 library `sweep.h` with optional C++11 header `sweep.hpp` on top of it.

### Quick Start

On linux:

```bash
# build the library (creates libsweep.so)
make
# install (puts libsweep.so in "/usr/lib")
sudo make install
```

If you are building on windows, install MinGW and MSYS. Be sure to follow the MinGW installation instructions for setting environment variables etc. Then, from the MSYS terminal, you can run:

```bash
# build the library (creates libsweep.dll)
make
# install (puts libsweep.dll in "C:\MinGW\bin")
make install
```

If you don't have a Sweep device yet you can build a dummy `libsweep.so` always returning static point cloud data:

```bash
make dummy
sudo make install
```

This dummy library is API and ABI compatible. Once your device arrives switch out the `libsweep.so` shared library and you're good to go.

### Usage

- Include `<sweep/sweep.h>` for the C interface or `<sweep/sweep.hpp>` for the C++ interface.
- Link `libsweep.so` with `-lsweep`.

For example:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c99 examples/example.c -lsweep
g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++11 examples/example.cc -lsweep
```

See [example.c](examples/example.c) and [example.cc](examples/example.cc) for a C and C++ example, respectively.


### libsweep

Before jumping into details, here are the library's main design ideas:

- Only opaque pointers (think typed `void *`) and plain C types in the API. This is how we accomplish ABI compatibility.
- No global state: `_s` context objects (`_s` since POSIX reserves `_t`) hold state and have to be passed explicitly.
- Make ownership and lifetimes explicit: all objects have to be `_construct()`ed for creation and successfully created objects have to be `_destruct()`ed for cleanup.
- Sane defaults and user-friendly API: when possible we provide `_simple()` functions e.g. doing serial port auto-detection.
- Fixed-size and signed integers for portability and runtime checking (think sanitizers).

#### Version And ABI Management

```c++
SWEEP_VERSION_MAJOR
```

Interface major version number.

```c++
SWEEP_VERSION_MINOR
```

Interface minor version number.

```c++
SWEEP_VERSION
```

Combined interface major and minor version number.

```c++
int32_t sweep_get_version(void)
```

Returns the library's version (see `SWEEP_VERSION`).
Used for ABI compatibility checks.

```c++
bool sweep_is_abi_compatible(void)
```

Returns true if the library is ABI compatible.
This check is done by comparing the interface header with the installed library's version.


#### Error Handling

```c++
SWEEP_ASSERT
```

Optionally define this for custom assertion handling.
Uses `assert` from `<assert.h>` by default.

```c++
sweep_error_s
```

Opaque type representing an error.
You can get a human readable representation using the `sweep_error_message` function.
You have to destruct an error object with `sweep_error_destruct`.

```c++
const char* sweep_error_message(sweep_error_s error)
```

Human readable representation for an error.

```c++
void sweep_error_destruct(sweep_error_s error)
```

Destructs an `sweep_error_s` object.


#### Device Interaction

```c++
sweep_device_s
```

Opaque type representing a Sweep device.
All direct device interaction happens on this type.

```c++
sweep_device_s sweep_device_construct_simple(sweep_error_s* error)
```

Constructs a `sweep_device_s` using defaults to detect the hardware.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
sweep_device_s sweep_device_construct(const char* port, int32_t bitrate, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Constructs a `sweep_device_s` with explicit hardware configuration.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
void sweep_device_destruct(sweep_device_s device)
```

Destructs an `sweep_device_s` object.

```c++
void sweep_device_start_scanning(sweep_device_s device, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Signals the `sweep_device_s` to start scanning.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
void sweep_device_stop_scanning(sweep_device_s device, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Signals the `sweep_device_s` to stop scanning.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
int32_t sweep_device_get_motor_speed(sweep_device_s device, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Returns the `sweep_device_s`'s motor speed in Hz.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
void sweep_device_set_motor_speed(sweep_device_s device, int32_t hz, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Sets the `sweep_device_s`'s motor speed in Hz.
The device supports speeds of 1 Hz to 10 Hz.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
void sweep_device_reset(sweep_device_s device, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Resets the `sweep_device_s` hardware.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.


#### Full 360 Degree Scan

```c++
sweep_scan_s
```

Opaque type representing a single full 360 degree scan from a `sweep_device_s`.

```c++
sweep_scan_s sweep_device_get_scan(sweep_device_s device, sweep_error_s* error)
```

Blocks waiting for the `sweep_device_s` to accumulate a full 360 degree scan into `sweep_scan_s`.
In case of error a `sweep_error_s` will be written into `error`.

```c++
void sweep_scan_destruct(sweep_scan_s scan)
```

Destructs a `sweep_scan_s` object.

```c++
int32_t sweep_scan_get_number_of_samples(sweep_scan_s scan)
```

Returns the number of samples in a full 360 degree `sweep_scan_s`.

```c++
int32_t sweep_scan_get_angle(sweep_scan_s scan, int32_t sample)
```

Returns the angle in milli-degree for the `sample`th sample in the `sweep_scan_s`.

```c++
int32_t sweep_scan_get_distance(sweep_scan_s scan, int32_t sample)
```

Returns the distance in centi-meter for the `sample`th sample in the `sweep_scan_s`.

```c++
int32_t sweep_scan_get_signal_strength(sweep_scan_s scan, int32_t sample)
```

Returns the signal strength (1 low -- 100 high) for the `sample`th sample in the `sweep_scan_s`.
